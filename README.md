Good afternoon)
This repository contains test task for Yandex.

**Purpose**: 
1) Find out the reason for the growing CPA;
2) Give recommendations for reducing and stabilizing CPA to the target value (380 rubles);

**Stack**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, MS Power Point

**Conclusions**:
1) Formula for calculating CPA (Cost Per Action) = Costs / Conversion, therefore, the lower the costs and the more targeted actions, the lower the CPA.
2) The study revealed that:
    - 2 advertising companies “image_ad” and “mcbanner” had significant costs and very low conversion;
    - Retargeting, that is, repeated work with users who were previously interested in the advertised goods/services also requires significant costs and has low conversion;
3) Recommendations for reducing and stabilizing CPA to the target value (380 rubles):
    - optimize or completely abandon the following advertising campaigns: “image_ad” and “mcbanner”;
    - optimize retargeting;
    - conduct an experiment and set an automatic strategy, where you set a target conversion cost of 380 rubles.
